# About-
Floweree is a cross platform game app which allows users to grow virtual plants over 10 days. The app will start by giving the user a seed which will then be planted and require the user to come back everyday to make sure their plant is receiving proper amounts of water. We plan to monitor this element with a bar scale which will range from red, light green, and green, and blue. If water amounts are adequate (the scale is in the light green to green range) then the plant will grow. If the scale is red or blue the plant will grow slower. If the scale goes below red the plant will die and the user will have to start over. 

# Our MVP-
Our MVP is to allow users to grow a daisy and will also have a soothing soundtrack that plays in the background.

# In the Future-
Beyond our MVP we would like to include a greater variety of plants in our shop feature, and allow for more factors to affect the plant (ex. fertilizer boosters, worms, natural disaster warnings, ect). We also want to be able to control the volume of the music within the app and thought about potentially having the actual weather of the users location be reflected in the app. For example, today it was raining in Saint Paul so ideally it would rain in the app so the flower would be automatically watered. Additionally, we would be interesting in adding an educational aspect to this game in which fun facts appear on the screen and teach the user gardening techniques.
